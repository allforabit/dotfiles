* Description
This layer converts vims linewise motion and editing keys to work better with lisp code.

It attempts to maintain the semantics of vim keyboard shortcuts but adapted for
use with the s-expression structure of lisp code.

It uses the following projects:
- Lispy by abo-abo
- Parinfer by Doglooksgood

It takes influence from the following projects:
- Cleverparens
- Lispy
- Lispyville
- Vim sexp (and better sexp mappings by Tim Pope)
- Spacemacs conventions for structured editing
- Spacemacs lisp mode

The aim is to make it the structured nature of the parentheses be the dominant 
navigational and editing paradigm and to move line by line and word by word
editing to the background.
